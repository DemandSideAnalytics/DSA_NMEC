This repository contains Python and Stata examples of Demand Side Analytics's construction of a Seasonal Time-of-Week and Temperature regression function for Population Normalized Metered Energy Consumption models. 

Both sets of functions are analogous, however the Python function has some additional features. In each folder, there is example code of simple use cases that rely on the dummy data provided. This dummy data is not designed to show program savings, rather it is set up to provide an example of the structure required for analysis.
